  <p>The New York Public Library is developing a major civic initiative aimed at turning historical maps and other geographic sources into a digital time-travel service for New York City.</p>
  <p>The NYC Space/Time Directory will make urban history accessible through a set of resources including: a searchable atlas of New York past, an historical location directory and geocoder, a set of APIs and data sets, and a discovery tool linking the Library's collections together in an historical and geographic context.</p>

  <p>These explorations will provide a way for scholars, students,  enthusiasts, and Librarians to explore New York City across time periods and to add their own knowledge and expertise.</p>

<div id="part7" class="bubble regular">
  <p>The Space/Time Directory is a model and codebase for other cities, libraries, and individuals to map and explore history. Data sources are listed in our related resources section below and those interested in working with our open code repos can visit<a href="https://github.com/nypl-spacetime">GitHub</a> to get started.!</p>
