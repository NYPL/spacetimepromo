    <p>The New York Public Library is creating a digital time-travel service for New York City with historical maps, collections rich in geospatial data, and the public's help.</p>
    <p>The NYC Space/Time Directory will make urban history accessible through a set of resources including: a searchable atlas of New York past, an historical location directory and geocoder, a set of APIs and data sets, and a discovery tool linking NYPL collections together in an historical and geographic context.</p>
    <p>These explorations will provide a way for scholars, students,  enthusiasts, and librarians to explore New York City across time periods and to add their own knowledge and expertise.</p>
    <p>With the NYC Space/Time Directory we're developing a programming model and freely accessible codebase for other cities, libraries, and individuals to map and explore history. Data sources are listed in our related resources section below and those interested in working with our open source projects can visit <a href="https://github.com/nypl-spacetime">GitHub</a> to get started!</p>
