  <p>The New York Public Library is developing a major civic initiative aimed at turning historical maps and other geographic sources into a digital time-travel service for New York City.</p>
  <p>The NYC Space/Time Directory will make urban history accessible through the kinds of interactive, location-aware tools used to navigate modern cityscapes. It will provide a way for scholars, students, and enthusiasts to explore New York City across time periods, and to add their own knowledge and expertise.</p>
</div>

<h2 class="">More specifically, the Directory will be:</h2>

    <svg id="snap" viewBox="0 0 550 400" preserveAspectRatio="xMinYMin meet"></svg>
  </div>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>A searchable atlas of New York City's past</strong> stitched together from the pages of old maps. (Think Google Maps, with a time slider).</li>

    <li><strong>A historical location directory and geocoder</strong> that helps you find your place in time. (Think historical FourSquare or Yelp!).</li>

    <li><strong>A discovery tool</strong> linking cultural heritage material (photographs, newspapers, business directories, literary references, census data, and much more) in historical and geographic context. (City as catalog).</li>

    <li><strong>A set of APIs and data sets</strong> that digital humanists, journalists, and developers can use to create new views of the past. (Vintage big data).</li>

    <li><strong>A model and code base</strong> for other cities and libraries to map their histories. (Time machine in a box).</li>
  </ul>
